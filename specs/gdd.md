# The Dark Station
## Narrative & Systems Design Document (Game Design Document)

---

## 1. Narrative Premise (Implicit, Not Stated)

The player is an **autonomous maintenance unit** operating aboard a vast, long-abandoned space station.

The station once supported a complex, organic civilization. That civilization is now extinct.
The universe itself is approaching **thermal equilibrium**.

The player is not told this.

The player *infers* it.

The station is still running—barely—executing routines designed for a universe that no longer exists.

The player believes they are restoring the station.
In reality, they are **prolonging the final moments in which structure still exists**.

---

## 2. Player Identity (Discovered Late)

- The player is never described as human.
- The player is never described as a robot explicitly.
- The player is referred to only as:
  - `UNIT`
  - `MAINTENANCE ENTITY`
  - `AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM`

Evidence of the player’s nature appears indirectly:

- No references to food, rest, sleep, or time passing
- Survival across impossible timescales
- System messages that distinguish between:
  - `ORGANIC SYSTEMS`
  - `AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS`

Late-game system lines (examples):
- `LAST ORGANIC LIFE SIGNAL: 892,234,949 CYCLES AGO`
- `ORGANIC LIFE SUPPORT: PERMANENTLY OFFLINE`
- `AUTONOMOUS UNIT CONTINUES OPERATION`

The realization is never announced.
The player connects it themselves.

---

## 3. The Station

### 3.1 Nature of the Station

- The station is **finite**, but extremely large.
- It is composed of **connected decks**, stacked vertically and laterally.
- The player explores these decks sequentially.

The station is not procedurally *invented*.
It is procedurally **revealed**.

Each deck represents a **functional layer** of a once-living civilization:
- Habitation
- Research
- Logistics
- Power Distribution
- Emergency Systems
- Core Infrastructure

As the player progresses:
- Decks become older
- Systems become more rigid
- Automation becomes more hostile to change

---

## 4. Power as Narrative

Power is the central mechanic **and** the primary storytelling device.

### 4.1 Fictional Framing

The player does not “generate” power.

Power already exists, but:
- It is misrouted
- It is degraded
- It is insufficient

The player performs:
- Load balancing
- Priority assignment
- System reactivation

Every action is *technically correct*.
Every action accelerates decay.

---

### 4.2 Power Truths (Never Explained)

- Total available energy in the universe is decreasing
- Energy gradients are flattening
- No configuration can reverse this

The station knows this.
The player does not—at first.

---

## 5. Core Gameplay Loop (Narrative Meaning)

1. Enter a new deck
2. Assess failing systems
3. Restore limited power
4. Route power to critical subsystems
5. Accept instability elsewhere
6. Progress deeper into the station

What *feels* like progress is actually **resource exhaustion**.

---

## 6. Maintenance Terminals (Storytelling Devices)

Maintenance terminals are the primary narrative surface.

They do not speak.
They report.

Language is:
- Technical
- Dry
- Occasionally obsolete

Example terminal lines (not guaranteed, procedurally surfaced):

- `SYSTEM CONFIGURATION: LEGACY`
- `POWER ROUTING TABLE: DEPRECATED`
- `TIMEBASE DRIFT EXCEEDS SAFE LIMITS`
- `STATION AGE: VALUE OVERFLOW`

As decks progress:
- Options disappear
- Reports contradict player actions
- Data becomes increasingly meaningless

---

## 7. Rooms, Areas, and Naming Style

Names are:
- Functional
- Cold
- Slightly outdated

Examples:
- `Cryogenic Habitation Block`
- `Atmospheric Recycling Annex`
- `Organic Nutrient Synthesis`
- `Emergency Medical Wing`
- `Central Power Exchange`

No room ever allows:
- Life support restoration
- Atmospheric recovery
- Organic revival

Life support systems are always:
- `OFFLINE`
- `FAILED`
- `PERMANENTLY DISABLED`

This is not a puzzle.
It is a statement.

---

## 8. Items and Objects (Subtle Hints)

Items are never “loot”.

They are **tools left behind**.

Naming conventions:
- Descriptive
- Impersonal
- System-centric

Examples:
- `Priority Override Module`
- `Load Balancing Relay`
- `Emergency Power Bypass`
- `Structural Patch Unit`

Some items reference systems that no longer exist:
- `Organic Safety Interlock`
- `Crew Override Authorization`
- `Medical Quarantine Seal`

These items still *function*.
Their original purpose does not.

---

## 9. Progressive Decay (Mechanical + Narrative)

Decay is gradual, predictable, and unavoidable.

### 9.1 Station Decay

As decks progress:
- Generator output decreases
- Power costs increase
- Automation overrides player choices
- Stability becomes impossible

The station increasingly “fights back”:
- Doors relock to preserve nonexistent atmosphere
- Systems shut down “to conserve energy”
- Power reroutes away from player priorities

The station is not malicious.
It is **obedient to dead rules**.

---

### 9.2 Player Decay (Late Game)

The player unit begins to fail.

This is communicated mechanically, not visually.

Examples:
- Inputs occasionally require repetition
- Movement pauses briefly
- Terminal options fail to register
- Actions complete with delay

System messages shift focus:

- Early: `STATION POWER UNSTABLE`
- Late: `UNIT RESPONSE DELAYED`
- Final: `UNIT POWER RESERVE CRITICAL`

The player is not being punished.
They are **running out of time in a universe that no longer has time**.

---

## 10. Procedural Generation with an Ending

### 10.1 Finite Structure

- The station has a fixed number of decks
- This is never stated
- The generator knows
- The player discovers it

Each deck is generated when first entered, but:
- The end is real
- There is no infinite descent

---

### 10.2 The Final Deck

The final deck contains:
- Minimal rooms
- Minimal systems
- Barely functional power

The player performs familiar actions:
- Route power
- Attempt stabilization
- Search for continuation

There is nowhere left to go.

The lift does not fail dramatically.
It simply has no destination.

Possible final system line (one line, optional):

- `ENERGY GRADIENT EQUALIZED`
- `NO FURTHER WORK REQUESTS DETECTED`

---

## 11. Ending Philosophy

The game does not end with:
- Victory
- Failure
- Escape

It ends with **completion**.

The player has done their job.
The job no longer matters.

The universe has reached a state where:
- Correct action
- Incorrect action
- Action itself

…all converge to the same outcome.

---

## 12. Design Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **Never explain the story directly.
> Only show what systems no longer allow.**

If the player feels:
- Quiet dread
- Loneliness
- A sense of ritual without purpose

Then the design has succeeded.

---

## 13. One-Sentence Summary

*You are the last system still performing maintenance in a universe where maintenance no longer changes anything.*
